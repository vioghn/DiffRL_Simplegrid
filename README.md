This project aims to enhance the Adaptive Horizon Actor-Critic (AHAC) algorithm by integrating it with the SimpleGrid environment. The AHAC algorithm, known for its effectiveness in reinforcement learning tasks, will be adapted to work seamlessly within the grid-based environment.

#### Training and Evaluation: 
Users can run the algorithm using the following command:<br>
```python train.py alg=ahac env=simplegrid``` <br>
